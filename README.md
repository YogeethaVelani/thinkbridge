Teashop_testInventory- This excel contains the test scenarios,the testcases and the tracker for the Question 1.
PHPTravel.java- This is a selenium java class which includes the test flow which was expected. However I couldnt complete the scenario,as the website had alot of hidden objects and I tried all the ways to automate the datepicker, but was really not able to detect and automate that object.
Time spent to locate the objects for PHP travels - 3 hours.
Defect in PHP Travel- Date Picker is not getting detected.
Possible reasons for not locating date picker - No permission to inspect the element.(Tried to locate the element through java script as well)
